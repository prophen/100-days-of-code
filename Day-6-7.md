# 100 Days of Code - Day 6 and 7

I didn't touch a code editor yesterday (day 6) but I did some work engaging with my community on Twitter.

I'm letting it be known that I want to work as a developer in a community or advocate role. Engaging with the community and writing documentation are skills I am working on demonstrating and creating a body of work around.
