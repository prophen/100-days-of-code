# Nikema's 100 Days of Code Challenge
![100 Days of Code](./images/100-doc.png)
I've attempted this several times and I have yet to get to the end of the challenge. I'm ready now and I wont give up until I reach day 100.

My focus is on documentation and learning git. I only had my first successful rebase yesterday (Feb. 15, 2020). I know git is powerful and I want to learn how to use it well.
